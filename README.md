# CS142: Web Applications

## Description

Stanford CS142 covers a wide range of web application concepts, as well as a suite of projects, focusing on the MERN stack (React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB), giving participants a comprehensive and practical understanding of web applications.

From my perspective, CS142 is not a simple introductory programming class, but rather quite difficult and requires the ability to pick up new languages and frameworks on one's own easily. For instance, most of the features of JavaScript are covered in two lectures (05-06). Another example is asking student to read several technical documents after class to figure out the details of CSS. Alternatively, CS142 treats web applications as a system with multiple high-level concepts, and different languages and frameworks as tools.

[TODO] I'll write a list of what I learned from this course when I finish it.
